## Graph Search

- Explore a Graph
- Find a Path from a node `S` to node `T`

### What is a Graph

- `V` = `set of vertices`
- `E` = `set of Edges` `≈` `e = {v,w} ∈ E` where `{v,w}` could be
  - _un-ordered - `un-directed graph`_
    - _`A ⎻ B ⎻ C ⎻ A` un-directed graph `V = {A, B, C, D}, E = {(A,B), (B,C), (C,A)}`_
  - _ordered - `directed graph`_
    - _`A ➟ B ➟ C ➟ B` - directed graph `V = {A, B, C, D}, E = {(A,B),(B,C),(C,B)}`_

### Applications (BFS mainly)

- Web Crawling
- Social Networking
- Network Broadcast
- Garbage Collection
- Model Checking
- Checking Mathematical Conjectures
- Solving Puzzles  / Games
